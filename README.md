Comparative Analysis of Distributed Key-Value Storage Systems
Description: This project focuses on evaluating and comparing different distributed key-value storage systems. The primary objective is to assess the performance and functionality of three popular systems: Cassandra, Redis, and MongoDB. Additionally, the project includes a study on ZHT, Cassandra, and Memcached, drawing insights from existing research.

Goals:

Evaluate the performance and scalability of Cassandra, Redis, and MongoDB as distributed key-value storage systems.
Analyze the features and capabilities offered by each system in terms of data management, fault tolerance, and consistency.
Compare the performance characteristics of ZHT, Cassandra, and Memcached based on relevant studies.
Provide insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and suitable use cases for each storage system.
